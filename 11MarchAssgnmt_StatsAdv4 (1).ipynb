    "A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to compare the means of two groups. The main difference between the two tests is the sample size and the knowledge of the population standard deviation. A t-test is used when the sample size is small (usually less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown. On the other hand, a z-test is used when the sample size is large (usually greater than 30) and the population standard deviation is known.\n",

In this case, the sum of the test scores is 855, so the sample mean is 855/10 = 85.5.\n",
